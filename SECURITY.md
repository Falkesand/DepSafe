## Reporting a Vulnerability

DepSafe is a personal hobby project maintained by one person in their spare
time. That said, I do care about security and will address reported issues as
soon as I reasonably can.

**Preferred: GitHub Security Advisories**

Go to the [Security tab](../../security/advisories) of this repository, click
"Report a vulnerability", and describe what you found.

**Alternative: Open an issue**

If the vulnerability isn't sensitive (no credential exposure, no RCE), feel
free to just open a regular GitHub issue.

## What Helps in a Report

- What went wrong and which part of the tool is affected
- Steps to reproduce
- Any fix ideas you might have

No need for a formal write-up. A short description is perfectly fine.

## What to Expect

- I'll acknowledge your report when I see it
- Fixes depend on my availability, but I'll do my best to act quickly on
  anything serious
- If you'd like credit in the release notes, just let me know

Thanks for helping make DepSafe better.
